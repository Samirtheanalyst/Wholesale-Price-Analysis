# Wholesale-price-Analysis
Project Summary
This project analyzes the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for 100+ crops from 2012 to 2024 using MySQL for querying and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for advanced data analysis and visualization.

The goal was to extract key insights on price trends, identify top-performing and declining crops, and create data-driven visual reports to support agricultural price analysis.

🔗 Tools & Technologies
✅ MySQL – For data storage, cleaning, and querying historical price data.
✅ Python (Pandas) – For data wrangling, transformation, and trend calculations.
✅ Matplotlib & Seaborn – For visualization of WPI trends, comparisons, and patterns.

📊 Key Outcomes
Processed & analyzed WPI data for 100+ crops across 12+ years.
Built 9 key insights using SQL queries and Python analysis, uncovering trends like:
Bajra had the highest WPI in Jan 2024.
Several crops experienced a WPI decline between Dec 2023 and Dec 2024.
Top 5 crops showed an average YoY WPI increase of 12%.
Developed visual dashboards showing WPI fluctuations, top gainers, and declining crops to enhance decision-making.

📈 Sample Insights
✔️ Average WPI in January 2024.
✔️ Top crop with highest WPI in December 2024.
✔️ Crops with declining WPI from Dec 2023 to Dec 2024.
✔️ WPI trend for Cotton from 2020 to 2024.
